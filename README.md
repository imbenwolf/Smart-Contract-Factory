### Compiles and minifies frontend for production

Due to a limitation by a used Truffle dependency, a development Ethereum blockchain needs to be running:\
**Run development ethereum blockchain as described under [Runs development ethereum blockchain](#runs-development-ethereum-blockchain).**

```
yarn build:frontend
```

### Deploys frontend on the [Swisscom Application Cloud](https://developer.swisscom.com/)

**Build the frontend as described under [Compiles and minifies frontend for production](#compiles-and-minifies-frontend-for-production).**

Make sure you have access to the application cloud space defined in ```deploy-frontend.js``` or modify it to your needs.

```
yarn deploy:frontend <environment>
```

Currently, two environments are available: ```testing``` and ```production```.
